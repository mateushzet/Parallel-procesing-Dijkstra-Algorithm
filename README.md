### Parallel Processing and Visualization of Dijkstra Algorithm (University Project)
This project implements a parallel version of Dijkstra's algorithm using PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) to speed up computations by distributing tasks across multiple nodes. 

It enhances performance by parallelizing the edge relaxation process. 

The algorithm calculates the shortest path from a source node to a destination node. 

Additionally, the graph structure and computed shortest path are visualized, providing a clear representation of the results.
